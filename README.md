# Advent2022

My solutions to Advent of Code 2022 in Elixir

## Wtf is Elixir?
Elixir is a pragmatic functional programming language with an awesome standard library (why I use it for Advent of Code) and easy concurrency.

## Where is the code for each day?
Under lib/days

## How do I run this?
1. Clone the repo
2. Install elixir/erlang (if you have `asdf` just run `asdf install` in the repo!)
3. Run:
  * `mix run_days` to run all the days
  * `mix run_days 25` to run a specific day
  * `mix test` to run all my tests (which include all example and real inputs)
